# Assignment-1

When the programme starts it has a simple loading screen. I decided to make an UI for a space craft as i thought it was the best suited for the assignment. 
To execute this I used a switch statement and a variable called state. This systems works with keypress, when a key is pressed (q,w,o or p) 
it switchs between each case in the switch statement. After the loading screen you are met with the main menu, the menu has 4 options Q ,W ,O or P. 
The menu also contains 2 features: A map and a mini radar. The map traces a line between two dots and when it reaches the other dot it re draws itself.
The radar has a circle that pulses outwards, when the circle touches the edge it starts back at the start and repeats.
If you press Q it will enter the screen in which it shows the fuel level of the aircraft. You then press P to go back to the main menu. The next function 
I have in my programme is a mini game inside of the programme. I decided to incorporate bugzap into my programme as i thought it was appropriate for the theme of
the assignment. You play a short game of bugzap in which i altered to make the game more exciting. I added in a second bug into the code to increase the difficulty.
After the game you again press P to go back to the main menu. The last function on my programme is a enlarged radar. The radar at certain parts draws a circle where the radar 
is and resets when the radar resets.
